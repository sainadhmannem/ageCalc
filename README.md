# ageCalc
two things i have done in this is:

1.Whenever you enter the date of birth in the date of birth field, age will be displayed at the bottom of that field.on every change it will automatically displays your age.
2.there is 3 dropdown lists in the form.those are dependent to each other.
for example, first if you choose india in Country Dropdown, it will automatically selects the remaining two, state dropdown and city dropdown.
if you choose the city dropdown first it will automatically selects the corresponding state of that city and country.

Note:Data i have used is completely hard-coded.
